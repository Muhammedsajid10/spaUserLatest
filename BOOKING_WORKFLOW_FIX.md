# Booking Workflow Fix - Proper Schedule + Booking Integration

## Problem Identified
The previous workflow had a critical flaw:
1. ✅ Fetched booking data first (`fetchDateData()`)
2. ✅ Built `appointmentsIndex` with existing bookings  
3. ✅ Called `getEmployeeSchedule` API for employee schedule
4. ❌ **Used schedule data directly without filtering against bookings**
5. ❌ Booking conflicts were not properly removed from time slots

## Fixed Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Booking Conflicts
```javascript
const { appointmentsIndex } = await fetchDateData(selectedDate);
```
- Gets ALL bookings from admin API
- Filters by selected date  
- Filters by selected employee (if specific professional chosen)
- Builds `appointmentsIndex[employeeId][dateKey][bookingId]` structure

### Step 2: Fetch Employee Schedule  
```javascript
const response = await bookingsAPI.getEmployeeSchedule(empId, formattedDate);
const scheduleData = response?.data || response;
const rawScheduleSlots = scheduleData.availableTimeSlots || [];
```
- Gets employee's configured schedule from admin
- Returns theoretical available time slots
- **Does NOT account for actual bookings** (API limitation)

### Step 3: Apply Booking Conflict Filtering (NEW!)
```javascript
const employeeBookings = appointmentsIndex[empId]?.[dateKey] || {};
const filteredSlots = rawScheduleSlots.filter(slot => {
  const slotStartTime = slot.time || slot.startTime;
  const slotEndTime = slot.endTime || addMinutesToTime(slotStartTime, duration);
  
  // Check for conflicts with existing bookings
  const hasConflict = Object.values(employeeBookings).some(booking => {
    const bookingStart = booking.startTime;
    const bookingEnd = booking.endTime;
    
    // Check for time overlap
    return (slotStartTime < bookingEnd && slotEndTime > bookingStart);
  });
  
  return !hasConflict;
});
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Proper Conflict Detection
- **Before**: Schedule API slots used directly (conflicts ignored)
- **After**: Each schedule slot checked against `appointmentsIndex`
- **Result**: Booked time slots properly excluded

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- Shows raw schedule slots from API
- Shows booking conflicts found
- Shows filtered result with conflict count
- Logs which slots were removed and why

### 3. Workflow Validation
- Verifies `appointmentsIndex` structure exists
- Handles missing employee booking data gracefully
- Falls back to local computation if API fails

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Employee with Existing Bookings
1. **Setup**: Employee has booking from 10:00-11:00 AM
2. **Expected**: Time slots 10:00, 10:15, 10:30, 10:45 should be missing
3. **Verify**: Check console logs for "CONFLICT DETECTED"

### Scenario 2: Multiple Service Bookings  
1. **Setup**: Employee has 3 separate service bookings same day
2. **Expected**: All conflicting time ranges excluded
3. **Verify**: `appointmentsIndex` contains all 3 bookings

### Scenario 3: No Existing Bookings
1. **Setup**: Employee has no bookings for selected date  
2. **Expected**: All schedule slots available
3. **Verify**: `beforeFilter === afterFilter` in console

## Console Debugging

Look for these key log messages:

```
[Time] WORKFLOW FIX - Filtering schedule slots against bookings:
  - rawScheduleSlots: 32
  - employeeBookings: 2  
  - bookingTimes: ["10:00-11:00", "14:30-15:30"]

[Time] CONFLICT DETECTED - Removing slot:
  - slotTime: "10:00-11:00"
  - conflictsWith: "10:00-11:00" 
  - bookingService: "Haircut"

[Time] WORKFLOW RESULT - Schedule slots after booking filter:
  - beforeFilter: 32
  - afterFilter: 28
  - removedConflicts: 4
```

## Validation Steps

1. **Open Developer Console** (F12)
2. **Navigate to Time Selection** page
3. **Select employee with existing bookings**
4. **Check console logs** for workflow messages
5. **Verify time slots** exclude booked times
6. **Test booking** - should not allow double-booking

## API Dependencies

- `bookingsAPI.getTotalBookingsFromAdminSide()` - Gets all bookings for filtering
- `bookingsAPI.getEmployeeSchedule()` - Gets employee schedule template  
- `appointmentsIndex` - Local conflict detection structure
- `addMinutesToTime()` - Time calculation utility

The workflow now properly integrates both schedule templates AND actual booking conflicts for accurate time slot availability.
