# ✅ FUTURE TIME FILTERING - CORRECT WORKFLOW ORDER

## How It Works Now (FIXED)

### Step 1: Business Logic Filtering (FIRST)
- ✅ Employee shift validation
- ✅ Booking conflict detection  
- ✅ Service duration validation
- ✅ Professional availability check
- ✅ All existing business rules

### Step 2: Future Time Filtering (LAST)
- ✅ Applied AFTER all business logic completes
- ✅ Only removes past times from final results
- ✅ Preserves all business logic decisions

## Code Flow:

```javascript
// 1. Business logic runs first and sets availableTimeSlots
setAvailableTimeSlots(businessLogicFiltered);

// 2. Future filter runs automatically via useMemo
const finalFilteredTimeSlots = useMemo(() => {
  return availableTimeSlots.filter(slot => isTimeSlotInFuture(slot, selectedDate));
}, [availableTimeSlots, selectedDate]);

// 3. UI displays finalFilteredTimeSlots
```

## Key Improvements:

1. **Proper Order**: Future filtering happens AFTER business logic, not before
2. **Automatic**: Uses useMemo so it updates whenever availableTimeSlots changes
3. **Debug Logs**: Clear console messages show the filtering sequence
4. **Non-Destructive**: Business logic remains unchanged, just adds final step

## Console Debug Output:

Look for these messages in the correct order:
1. `[Time] EMPLOYEE-SPECIFIC BOOKING CONFLICTS` (business logic)
2. `[Time] STEP 3 - ENHANCED WORKFLOW RESULT` (business logic complete)  
3. `[Time] FINAL FUTURE FILTER (after all business logic)` (future filter applied)

## Result:
- Midnight bookings: ✅ Properly blocked by business logic
- Past times: ✅ Removed by future filter
- Future availability: ✅ Shows only valid, future time slots
